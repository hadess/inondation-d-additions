# Inondation d'Additions

This educational software was written for the Thomson line of 8-bit computers
in Microsoft BASIC. It will test pupils for their ability to perform additions
in columns, with or without a carry. Incorrect additions will raise the sea
level below the hero, standing on a cliff. If too many incorrect answers are
given, the hero will drown before it can be saved by an incoming rescue
helicopter.

## History

This program was written on a TO9 computer by then primary school teacher
Daniel Nocera, as part of a country-wide training program into IT literacy,
following on from the “Plan Informatique pour Tous” launched in 1985.
